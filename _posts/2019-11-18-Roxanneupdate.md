Here goes my first post. Learning about Jekyll, Github, a few NPM things, and just what it means to be building a website. I have worked a little with wordpress, but this way is new to me. Forums on github have seemed to be helpful. the .yml file is so confusing. been working with trying to get it updated, then I go to my html files and manually change what I wanted to change in .yml, but why is it that the yml file is telling me to change things there as if it is the root? As usuall, there are a lot of ups and downs.

But it doesn't feel like heart break any more when things go wrong. This summer I took a course in webserver programming. The essentials that were taught in that class, I just followed them like Ikea instructions and still had no idea what I was doing. It didn't even seem like success to me. Finally I got around to using webhost000 which was mentioned to me in that course, configured it with wordpress and made a website, which is pretty much what they wanted me to do. I just did that on my own now. I guess knowledge comes in handy later.

I studied political science before which is nothing like programming. The amount of confidence I feel like those students have in polisci is amazing. In programming its totally different. I have gotten used to it. And I guess now with everything I am building from testing with html, python, c#, that I was practicing last year, it is coming in handy this year. I was constantly frustrated last year, but now I just cry a river, build a bridge, and get the heck over it!
