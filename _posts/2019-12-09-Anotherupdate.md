HELLOOOOOO WORRRRLD! 

I finally got Jekyll to work! First I had to clean the NPM cache, then reinstall Jekyll because a Gem was missing. 
Then for some reason I needed to Reinstall Docker too. It was complete reactivation mode for me. There was 
no other choice, and I am not sure why but I think it is because I added a plugin a while back that just was not 
compatible and didnt work well with Ruby. 

I tried to install Gatsby.js, and I thought since we are using script in HTML for javascript that it would be the most 
compatible with the server, the languages... but it didn't work that well. So I went back to Jekyll. 

I am starting to see that the client-server interaction really is a hostile work environment. I was literally sitting 
for 12 hours straight trying to figure out what is wrong with my files. I came back to this assignment after one week
and a half and began working again to get everything to work.
