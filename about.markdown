I am a student at LNU. I want to learn how to program. Right now I am learning about Javascript. 
I am wondering how different JS is from backend languages. Currently I am interested in new learning techniques that 
will help me to better understand all languages. 

You can learn a little bit more about me here: http://roxanneiheanacho.000webhostapp.com/

Thanks for stopping by. 

By the way, here is a poster I made in my other class. We learned 
photoshop, and I think it is pretty cool!
