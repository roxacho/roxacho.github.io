# So, Who are you? 
My name is Roxanne, I worked at a Tech Start up before on the client side (as in communications, event management, and business management part, which had nothing to do with the developer side) which inspired me to learn about programming. I am half Swedish, half Iranian, raised in the US, have spent quite a lot of time in Sweden though (Malmo, GÃ¶teborg, and Uppsala finally) I am a student at LNU. I want to learn how to program. Right now I am learning about Javascript. when there are so many "Things" To learn on the internet. So many languages, terms, things that link together. And all of them being intangible in a way it is hard to grasp (literally).

I am also very pregnant as of December 2019! I Will have my first child soon, so that is exciting! But pregnancy is making me forget things. So It is sometimes hard to focus.

Wait, what was I talking about again..? Oh yeah! 
So: 
I am wondering how different JS is from backend languages. Currently I am interested in new learning techniques that 
will help me to better understand all languages. I think I would like to learn more about PHP and just the Client - Server relationship, which is apparently very hostile? Interesting. 

##  Where Can We Learn More About You

I made a blog on a wordpress site I got from another course. Here you can see an Avi I made with Adobe Illustrator, and other things

Thanks for stopping by. 

###  Post Something Just For Fun? 
This song is popular in the US right now, and my aunt keeps singing 
it to me because...well obviously the name. When will they ever stop making songs about this mysterious 
Roxanne person? 

Catchy song though! Nice to have something upbeat in such bad Swedish winter weather.
